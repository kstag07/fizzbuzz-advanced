This program will ask a user for an initial number.  It will then ask the user for a set of numbers and words to be associated with the numbers so that if the initial number is divisible by any of the numbers it wil return a string of combined words associated with the numbers that have no remainder when divided into the initial number.  If no numbers can divide into the initial number, then the initial number is returned.
